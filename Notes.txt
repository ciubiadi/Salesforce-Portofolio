Dev Hub = It is the main Salesforce org that I will use to create and manage my scratch orgs
Scratch Org = It is a source-driven and disposable deployment of Salesforce code and metadata. Scratch Orgs are driven by 
source, Sandboxes and copies of production.

Scratch orgs do not replace sandboxes!!
