Dev Hub = It is the main Salesforce org that I will use to create and manage my scratch orgs
Scratch Org = It is a source-driven and disposable deployment of Salesforce code and metadata. Scratch Orgs are driven by 
source, Sandboxes and copies of production.

Scratch orgs do not replace sandboxes!!

I can use @track for address for example or any data that needs to be digged ( in case of the object
I need to access the propery so it will not work without annotation of track. ).
However, I do prefer to mutate the data with the spread operator.

!!! In other words, always remember when I am using OBJECT or ARRAY, I should use @track OR to update directly
the value of the property, not the specific field inside that object.

@track Property : 
When a field contains an object or an array, there's a limit to the depth of changes that are tracked. To tell the
framework to observe changes to the properties of an object or to the elements of an array, decorate the field with
@track.

Normal Property vs @track property
Without using @track, the framework observes changes that assign a new value to a field/property. If the new value is 
not === to the previousvalue, the component re-renders.!!!
